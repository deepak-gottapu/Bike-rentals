Predicting the number of bikes rented in an hour using decision trees

In many American cities, there are communal bicycle sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or by the day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities, and has detailed data available about how many bicycles were rented by hour and by day.Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto compiled this data.

This project aims to predict the number of bikes rented in an hour using decision trees and compare its performance with linear regression.
